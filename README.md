# DSA-With-Python

Short collection of Data Structures & Algorithms examples implemented in Python. Each folder groups problems by topic or difficulty and contains runnable example scripts.

## Contents

- `basic-Questions/` — small/basic practice problems (counts, palindrome, simple logic).
- `easy-Questions/` — easy-level problems and factor/frequency helpers.
- `Hashing-Basics/` — hashing examples and character-hashing utilities.
- `loops/` — loop practice scripts.
- `Recursion/` — recursion examples (head-tail recursion variations).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (any recent 3.x should work)
- No external packages required — pure Python scripts.

## Quick start

1. Open the repository folder.
2. Run a script with Python, for example:

	python basic-Questions/palindrome.py

3. To run other examples, change the path to the script you want and run with `python`.

## Contributing

- Add new algorithm examples under an appropriate folder.
- Name files descriptively and keep functions small and focused.
- Add brief comments or docstrings explaining inputs/outputs.

## Notes

- This repo is intended for learning and quick reference. Feel free to reorganize or add tests and examples.

If you want, I can expand this README with a navigation table, run examples, or add a CONTRIBUTING guide.

## What I have done

- Implemented core practice problems grouped by topic: loops, basic problems, easy problems, hashing basics, recursion, sorting, and Fibonacci.
- Added small, focused scripts for common tasks:
	- Palindrome checks (`basic-Questions/palindrome.py`, `loops/PalindromeUSingloops.py`, `0009-palindrome-number/0009-palindrome-number.py`).
	- Counting and simple arithmetic helpers (`basic-Questions/count.py`, `basic-Questions/counting.py`).
	- Frequency and factor utilities (`easy-Questions/frequncey.py`, `easy-Questions/factors.py`, `easy-Questions/bestfactor.py`).
	- Hashing demonstrations (`Hashing-Basics/hashing.py`, `Hashing-Basics/optimalhashing.py`, `Hashing-Basics/dicationary.py`, character-hash examples).
	- Recursion examples covering head recursion, tail recursion, parameterized recursion, and small recursion problems (`RECURSION/**`).
	- Sorting implementations: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, and Merge (`SORTING-ALGORITHMS/**`).
	- Fibonacci example (`fibonacci/fib.py`).

- Files are written as standalone Python scripts — easy to run and adapt for learning.
- No external dependencies; intended for learners to read, run, and modify.

If you'd like, I can convert this into a table-of-contents with direct links and short descriptions for every file.
