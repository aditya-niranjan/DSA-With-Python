# DSA-With-Python

Short collection of Data Structures & Algorithms examples implemented in Python. Each folder groups problems by topic or difficulty and contains runnable example scripts.

## Contents

- `basic-Questions/` — small/basic practice problems (counts, palindrome, simple logic).
- `easy-Questions/` — easy-level problems and factor/frequency helpers.
- `Hashing-Basics/` — hashing examples and character-hashing utilities.
- `loops/` — loop practice scripts.
- `Recursion/` — recursion examples (head-tail recursion variations).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (any recent 3.x should work)
- No external packages required — pure Python scripts.

## Quick start

1. Open the repository folder.
2. Run a script with Python, for example:

	python basic-Questions/palindrome.py

3. To run other examples, change the path to the script you want and run with `python`.

## Contributing

- Add new algorithm examples under an appropriate folder.
- Name files descriptively and keep functions small and focused.
- Add brief comments or docstrings explaining inputs/outputs.

## Notes

- This repo is intended for learning and quick reference. Feel free to reorganize or add tests and examples.

If you want, I can expand this README with a navigation table, run examples, or add a CONTRIBUTING guide.
