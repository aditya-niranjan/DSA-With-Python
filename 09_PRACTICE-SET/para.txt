#######, #######, l#ttle star,
### # wonder what you are!
up above the world so h#gh,
l#ke a d#amond #n the sky.
when the blaz#ng sun #s gone,
when he noth#ng sh#nes upon,
then you s### your l#ttle l#ght,
#######, #######, all the n#ght.

then the traveler #n the dark
thanks you for your t#ny spark,
### could he see where to go,
#f you d#d not ####### so?

#n the dark blue sky you keep,
often through my curta#ns peep
for you never shut your eye,
t#ll the sun #s #n the sky.

as your br#ght and t#ny spark
l#ghts the traveler #n the dark,
though # know not what you are,
#######, #######, l#ttle star.
